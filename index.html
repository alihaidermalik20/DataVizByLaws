        <h4>Why are we focusing on the economic contribution in Canada?</h4>
        <p>
          Immigration is a global phenomenon, and Canada, as one of the major
          immigrant-receiving countries, offers an ideal case study. Immigration
          has played an integral role in shaping Canada's socio-economic
          landscape. Over the years, Canada has embraced immigration to offset
          its aging population and labor shortages. The country's diverse and
          inclusive society, along with its policy of encouraging immigration,
          makes it a compelling subject of study.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the discourse around immigration often lacks data-driven
          insights, which can lead to misinformation and unfounded biases. This
          project aims to bring a data-centric perspective to the discourse,
          fostering a better understanding of immigrants' roles in Canadian
          society. We believe that this visualization is specifically designed
          for Canadian immigration officials, considering their unique role in
          shaping immigration policy. The power of data to shape narratives and
          influence decision-making processes is also of great interest.
        </p>
        <h4>How can we evaluate the impact of immigrants on economics?</h4>
        <p>
          Globally, we can try to explore the relationship between GDP per
          capita and the immigration data of different developed countries, for
          example G7. When focusing on Canada, we can try to look at the
          national income contribution by immigrants. The average or median
          incomes between local Canadian and immigrants can also be compared.
          Employment rate can also be used to see the percentage of immigrants
          who are contributing to society. The relationship economic
          contribution and different aspects of immigrants will also be
          explored, including gender, number of landed years, educational
          levels, visa types and birthplace by continents.
        </p>
        <p>
          All data used in this project is from World Bank and Canada census,
          which are official and authoritative.
        </p>
        <h4>
          How can we explore if there is a positive impact from immigrants
          positively?
        </h4>
        <p>
          This project forms a coherent narrative about the economic
          contributions of immigrants in Canada. The story begins with an
          overview of immigration in developed countries, setting the global
          context. It then delves into the specifics of Canada, examining the
          relationship between GDP and employment rate. We further narrow our
          focus to the demographic makeup of immigrants in Canada, linking it to
          their employment rate. Then, we explore how education influences
          employment and income levels, ultimately leading to a discussion on
          different immigration schemes and their economic contributions.

          Global overview of immigration in developed countries (G7)
        </h4>
        <p>
          Exploring the immigration globally can always give us insights if
          there is a relationship between immigration and economic contribution,
          especially in developed countries like G7, which have huge success
          economically.
        </p>
        <h4>Global immigration composition</h4>
        <p>
          In the following Sankey graph, it shows the migration of immigrants
          from their birthplaces (top 10 countries of origin) to the developed
          countries (G7).

          Exploring the correlation of GDP per capita and the annual net
          immigrants
        </h4>
        <p>
          It is not easy to observe the absolute relationship between GDP per
          capita and the numbers of immigrants moving in. We can explore the
          data from World Bank to try to find a correlation
        </p>

        <p>
          The graph shows the average GDP per capita in US dollars for G7
          countries for the years 2010-2021. We can see some effect of a rise on
          net immigration on GDP per capita in US dollars in the following
          years. For example, a rise in Net Immigrants in 2016 is followed by a
          rise in GDP per Capita in 2017 and 2018 or a fall in Net Immigrants in
          2013 and 2014 is followed by a fall in GDP per Capita in 2015 and
          2016.
          <span class="font-italic"
            >There is likely a positive correlation between GDP per capita and
            net immigrants related to net immigrants of 4 years ago.</span

		<p>Here, we relate the GDP per capita of that year and the net immigration number of precious year(s). 
			If we can observe a rising line cross different spots, it shows a positive correlation between 2 factors.
			For the effect of net immigration of last year on GDP per Capita, it becomes positive for all except US, UK, and Canada. Italy shows a strong correlation of 0.75 of last year net immigration on GDP per capita. 
			Correlation of net immigrants 2 years prior on the GDP per capita shows a positive correlation for all except Canada and UK. However, the average correlation is still quite low at 0.225.
			Net immigrants of 3 years prior correlation with GDP per capita show only UK as negative correlation with average correlation of 0.32
			Net immigrants of 4 years prior correlation with GDP per capita, all countries show a positive correlation with an average correlation of 0.38 and with United States showing strong correlation of 0.73.
			<span class="font-italic">We can conclude that immigration could have a positive correlation in the G7 countries and the effect is stronger after 4 years varying from country to country.</span>
